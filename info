CSCB07 – Software Design Lab 1
 Objectives
 Getting familiar with Java
 Learning how to compile and run a Java program from a command line
 Getting familiar with Git
Logistics
 This lab is worth 3% of the course grade and it will be supervised by your TA during the tutorial sessions of Weeks 2 & 3. If you encounter any problem while doing the steps listed in the next section, ask the TA for help.
 Attendance will be taken during the tutorial. If you are unable to attend any of the two sessions in Weeks 2 & 3, please send your TA an email explaining why and make sure to submit the deliverables by the due date. Failing to do so might result in a 10% penalty.
 The lab should be done individually.
 The due date is May 28, 2023.
Instructions
1. Download and install JDK:
https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html
2. Windows users might have to set the JAVA_HOME environment variable as follows:
Control Panel -> System and Security -> System -> Advanced system settings -> Advanced -> Environment Variables -> System Variables -> New and set JAVA_HOME by specifying the path to the JDK directory (the path on your machine might be different than the one shown in the example below)

3. If Git is not installed on your machine, download it and then install.
4. If you don’t have a Github account, create one here.
5. Create a personal access token to be used for authentication. More information could be found
here.
6. On Github, create a repo named b07lab1 as per these instructions and make sure to make it public.
7. Navigate to the repo and create a new file: name it “info”, add some information about the lab,
and click the “Commit new file” button.
8. On your machine, do the following steps using Command Prompt/Terminal:
a. Clone the repo using the command git clone RepoURL (RepoURL should be replaced by the actual URL of your repo)
b. cd b07lab1
c. Windows users:
notepad Polynomial.java (answer “Yes” when asked if you want to create a new file)
Mac users:
touch Polynomial.java open Polynomial.java
d. Develop class Polynomial as follows:
i. It has one field representing the coefficients of the polynomial using an array of
double. A polynomial is assumed to have the form 𝑎0 + 𝑎1𝑥1 + ⋯ + 𝑎𝑛−1𝑥𝑛−1. For example, the polynomial 6 − 2𝑥 + 5𝑥3 would be represented using the array [6, -2, 0, 5]
ii. It has a no-argument constructor that sets the polynomial to zero (i.e. the corresponding array would be [0])
iii. It has a constructor that takes an array of double as an argument and sets the coefficients accordingly
iv. It has a method named add that takes one argument of type Polynomial and returns the polynomial resulting from adding the calling object and the argument
v. It has a method named evaluate that takes one argument of type double representing a value of x and evaluates the polynomial accordingly. For example, if the polynomial is 6 − 2𝑥 + 5𝑥3 and evaluate(-1) is invoked, the result should
be 3.
vi. It has a method named hasRoot that takes one argument of type double and
determines whether this value is a root of the polynomial or not. Note that a root
is a value of x for which the polynomial evaluates to zero.
e. Save the file
f. Windows users:
notepad Driver.java (answer “Yes” when asked if you want to create a new file)
Mac users:
touch Driver.java open Driver.java
g. Add the following code, then save and close the file
  Summer 2023

public class Driver {
public static void main(String [] args) {
} }
h. javac Driver.java
i. java Driver
Polynomial p = new Polynomial(); System.out.println(p.evaluate(3));
double [] c1 = {6,0,0,5};
Polynomial p1 = new Polynomial(c1);
double [] c2 = {0,-2,0,0,-9};
Polynomial p2 = new Polynomial(c2); Polynomial s = p1.add(p2); System.out.println("s(0.1) = " + s.evaluate(0.1)); if(s.hasRoot(1))
System.out.println("1 is a root of s"); else
System.out.println("1 is not a root of s");
j. Verify that the output you obtain is as follows:
0.0
s(0.1) = 5.8041 1 is a root of s
k. git add *.java
l. git commit -m “added Polynomial.java and Driver.java”
m. gitpush
9. Submit the URL of your repo to “Lab 1” on Quercus.
Evaluation
 Git: 1 pt
 Java code: 2 pts
 A 10% penalty will be applied for missing the tutorial with no valid excuse
